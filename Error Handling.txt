ERRORS:
- whenever the error occurs it crashes the whole program.
Types of Errors:
1. Syntax error --> gramatical mistake or any other mistake written wrong in the code.
2. Runtime error (or) exception // any error occurs when program is running.
3. Logical error --> suppose if you're expecting an output to be 5 but it came out to be 6 then it is called logical error.
// L error occurs due to improper use of operators or wrong algorithm.

InputMisMatchExcpetion - this error occurs if we enters the wrong input.

//       Throwable

{ checked exceptions are checked at compile time eg. IOexception
Unchecked exceptions are checked at runtime. eg. InputMisMatchException. }

Keywords To handle Exceptions:

1.1 try : represents/contains code that we think has probabilty to generate/throw error at Runtime(exception).
1.2 catch : executes only if any error/exception occurs in try block. if there is no exception it will not execute.
1.3 finally : Finally bloxk executes irrespective of if any exception is occuring in try block or not.
1.4 throw : it is used to raise exceptions manually.
1.5 throws : temporary fix exception and need to add try catch block
